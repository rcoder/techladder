# Introduction

The below titles describe seniority along four main axes: 

Skills (knowledge) and scope: (Airship value Grit)
* Technical skills
* Domain knowledge
* Contribution level and scope of work

Collaboration and communication: (Airship values Collaboration, Diversity)
* Collaboration and interaction within and outside the team 
* Communication both internal to team and external to cross-functional team

Leadership and mentoring: (Airship value Integrity)
* Independence and self-direction
* Coaching and mentoring
* Culture impact within the team and across the company

Customer success: (Airship value Customers)
* Product curiosity
* Customer focus
* Product and market landscape knowledge

Expectations for each role along these dimensions are additive, which means you are expected to meet expectations for the role you are in and all the ones below your title.

Most industry ladders focus almost entirely on the first of these four and expect anyone showing signs of good mentoring or leadership to move directly into management. This approach often takes very capable, happy engineers and turns them into mediocre, unhappy managers. That's bad for everyone involved.

## Sr. Distinguished Engineer

**Management Equivalent**: Senior Director

Title bestowed only by action of exec staff. Candidates should show all of the characteristics and skills of a distinguished engineer, as well as being critical to the success, reputation, and technical excellence of the entire organization and not just technology. It is expected that this role will have influence outside the company with involvement in market assessment and M&A activities.

## Tech Lead Role

* The tech lead role is not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that any engineer may take on once they reach the senior level.
* You will be working with team members to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring.
* You will be responsible for the entire project and scale yourself by delegating work effectively without micromanaging.
* You should focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to increase the impact of the team’s work product.
* It is not required that a Sr. or Staff Engineer should work as a tech lead to progress, but it is the most common way for engineers to grow to a Principal Engineer.

## Architecture Role

### What?
Architecture deals with the significant design decisions. These by definition are things that would be difficult to change (take a long time) or would have widespread impact throughout the system. The ability to distinguish between what is design and what is architecture takes experience and knowledge about the environment. It’s the Architecture Teams responsibility to help identify when architecture choices are being made and help steer them to an optimal outcome. We are trying to avoid any unintentional architecture and design that is unsustainable.

### Why?

Why do we have an Architecture Team? 
* To be helpful to Engineering.
* * Communicating with the Architecture team to identify trends that need general solutions. Converge on uniformity.
* * Bring examples and processes from other successfully run projects.
* * Ensure that practices are sustainable. This means ensuring that we are applying/creating a standard wherever possible.
* Negotiate requirements with Product. Help guide requirements so they are actionable by Engineering.
* * What does that mean?
* * Who is asking for this?
* * Would it satisfy the requirement if… ?
* To be helpful to Product Management.
* * Challenge estimates from Engineering. Help identify risks in implementation.
* * * Why is this 3 weeks instead of 2 days?
* * * Would it simplify things if…?
* * * Could we do X now and Y later?
* * * X isn’t possible given the current speed of light.

### How?
How does the Architecture Team help? 
* Being Involved in the project as early as possible. Even before the project is resourced with Engineers the Architecture team validates that’s feasible. Good software starts with good requirements. Applying Architecture after the fact isn’t a good position to be in.
* Being embedded in teams that are implemented features. This allows the Architecture Team member to have context as the feature develops. During the course of development requirements and solutions will change. The Architecture member is there to challenge for optimal outcomes, provider larger context and interface with Product.
* Meeting with the other Architecture members regularly. This is how we share broader context about what is happening with the state of development.

## Engineering Lead Role

This is a variation of the Tech Lead role which has people reporting responsibilities (less than 4 people). This role provides exposure and experience to people who are interested in moving to the management ladder in future. You will be expected to meet all the above requirements for “Tech Lead” role and in addition:
* Undergo some form of management training at the company or outside.
* Conduct regular 1:1 meetings with your team.
* Provide feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted.
* You will be writing performance reviews and participating in company review cycles.

# Managers

Good managers can do a lot to make their team successful, but part of successful management is learning to delegate and stop doing the technical work that you used to own. Day-to-day management work is very interrupt-driven, which makes it hard to consistently produce good code.
